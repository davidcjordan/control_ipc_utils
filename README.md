# control IPC testing

ctrl_messaging_routines contain the primitives to send GET/PUT messages

These scripts use a file "control_ipc_defines.py" which define the parameters, ranges, defaults etc.  The file is generated by running "make_defines.py" which parses some of the .h files in the base code (infrastructure).  The file is generated to insure the defines used by scripts are the same as used by the base code.

scripts to control boomer:
- calib:
    - if called with no args, will get the camera calibration points
    - the 2nd arg specifies the camera ID
    - if called with -- arguments, e.g. --nblx for Near Baseline Left X, will PUT just those points
    - if called witout -- args, the calib points a positional - have to populate at least 10 X and 10 Y points
    - examples:
        - `./calib`  <- gets the values for the left camera (cam 0)
        - `./calib 1`  <- gets the values for the right camera (cam 1)
        - `./calib 0 -h`  <-shows the argument names for each calib point
        - `./calib 1 --nblx 12.3 --nbly 45.6 --nbrx 78.9 --nbry 20.2`  <-using args to set specific points
        - `./calib 0 100.1 200.1 100.1 1000.1 100.1 1500.1 500.2 200.2 1000.2 500.2 1500.2 500.2 700.3 200.3 700.3 500.3 700.3 1500.3 900.4 200.4`

- game: starts a game; use game -h to get a list of args (tiebreaker, level, grunts, serving modes, runless)
- drill: starts a drill; besides level, args are -i for drill num, -s speed, -H height, -d delay; but use drill -h to get a list of args.
- stop: sends stop command and will stop the drill or game.  No arguments.
- pause:
- resume:

Note: pause & resume are links to stop that must be created locally by the following commands:
- `ln -s stop pause`
- `ln -s stop resume`
