# control IPC testing

ctrl_messaging_routines contain the primitives to send GET/PUT messages

These scripts use a file "control_ipc_defines.py" which define the parameters, ranges, defaults etc.  The file is generated by running "make_defines.py" which parses some of the .h files in the base code (infrastructure).  The file is generated to insure the defines used by scripts are the same as used by the base code. The .h files that are parsed are:
- ipc_control:  defines related to ipc messages: RSRC, parameters
- global_parameters.h: defines related to speed adjustments, level, delay, height for drill & games
- fault.h converts the FAULT enums to defines
- drill.h


scripts to control boomer:

- game: starts a game; use game -h to get a list of args (tiebreaker, level, grunts, serving modes, runless)
- drill: starts a drill; besides level, args are -i for drill num, -s speed, -H height, -d delay; but use drill -h to get a list of args.
- stop: sends stop command and will stop the drill or game.  No arguments.
- faults:
- pause:
- resume:

Note: pause & resume are links to stop that must be created locally by the following commands:
- `ln -s stop pause`
- `ln -s stop resume`
